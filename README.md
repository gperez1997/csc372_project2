Language Compiler/Translator into Python

Repository Has a multitude of test and example text files of what the invented language is. The java and jar files are the compiler/translator programs; the java file is the original one with the parsing and translator code, while the jar file is here in case running the java file in command prompt does not work. THe way to run the file and created programs is detailed inside the Project2.java file as a header comment (one can also run simple command prompts).
